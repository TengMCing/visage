\title{List of symbols in the abstract syntax tree of the expression}
\description{
A list, will be initialized after an instance is built.
}
\examples{

# Constant variable
a <- 1

# Random uniform variable
b <- RAND_UNIFORM$instantiation()

# Define a closed form expression
cf <- CLOSED_FORM$instantiation(~3 * (exp(a) + b))

cf

# Get the list of symbols
cf$sym

# Get the list of symbol names
cf$sym_name

# Get the list of symbol types
cf$sym_type

d <- RAND_NORMAL$instantiation()

# Define a closed form expression with another closed form expression
cf2 <- CLOSED_FORM$instantiation(~cf + 3 * d)

cf2

# Get the list of symbols, constants are not counted as symbols
cf2$sym

# Get the list of symbol names
cf2$sym_name

# Get the list of symbol types
cf$sym_type
